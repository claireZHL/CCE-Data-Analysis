# CCE Data Analysis
 This project, conducted under the Center of Community Energy (CCE), aims to investigate the opinions of the San Diego community regarding e-bikes. The objective is to provide recommendations to San Diego County regarding the development of regulations related to e-bikes.
 The documents stored in this repository illustrate the methodology we employed to analyze survey data gathered both from the San Diego community and online sources. The analysis process mainly consists of four parts:
 
 - Step 1 : Survey Data Cleaning
In this phase, we loaded 3 raw survey data files into JupyterNote Book. Each response is cleaned for easier future analysis.
 - Step 2 : SD Zipcode Clustering
In this phase, we adopted unsupervised k-means clustering to divide San Diego county into smaller groups of similar demographic characters.
 - Step 3 : Survey Data Labeling
In this phase, we assigned cluster labels obtained in step 2 to our own survey data.
 - Step 4 : Survey Data Visualization by Clusters
In this phase, we visualized our survey data by each cluster using Tableau.
